# Big-data-analytics of-NYC-taxi-and-Subway---Hadoop
This is the Hadoop program of my project of big data analytics on NYC taxi and subway

There are five Java programs. Subway.java is used to handle the subway data, TaxiSpeed is used for taxi data. The purpose of these two files are to calculate the average speed of subway and taxi in NYC. BatchProcessing.java is used to pre-process the raw data in batch. Merge.java is used to combine the analytical results of different subway routes together. 

This project also has other analytics program in Python and Pig Latin, which are not included here.

Thank you!
